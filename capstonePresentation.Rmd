## The Application
The Shiny application developed for the Capstone assignment predicts the next word in a sentence. The user enters a series of word and the model predicts the next word using a Natural Language Statistical Model. The user interface is shown below. A documentation tab presents the content also available in this presentation

Need to upload latest on github and use download link for the screnshot of homage here

## The Model
To build the model, we use a corpus of blogs, news and twitter entires provided as part of the assignment.

- We have cleaned up the blogs, news and twitter entries to remove stop words, profanity
- The text resources are loaded in a VCorpus object which is then tokenized. We tokenize the corpus in bigrams, trigrams and 4grams
- We then build a DocumentTerm Matrix and calculate frequencies of each gram
- The model will be statistical based on a n-grams approach [see this article](https://towardsai.net/p/nlp/how-do-language-models-predict-the-next-word) or [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/sentence-generation-with-n-gram-21a5eef36a1b)


## The Algorithm

- Given the number of words in the input text, we look up the most frequent bigram, trigram or 4gram
- If the ngram lookup does not return a match, we call the (n-1)gram lookup. This strategy is refered to as **backoff**. Meaning the highest order ngram lookup is called and if no match is identified, the algorithm backs off to the next lower order ngram and so on.
